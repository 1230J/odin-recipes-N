        <h2>A Little History</h2>
        <p>When John Chandler submitted this lasagna recipe to Allrecipes more than 20 years ago, he had no idea how successful it would become. 
            One of our top-performing recipes of all time, World's Best Lasagna racks up more than 7 million views per year and has ranked among 
            the most popular lasagna recipes on the internet for two decades. 
            Unfortunately, John unexpectedly passed away at 53 years old.

        </p>

        <h3><em>Ingredients</em></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1 pound</strong> of sweet Italian Sausage</li>
            <li><strong>3/4 pound</strong> lean ground beef</li>
            <li><strong>1/2 cup</strong> minced onion</li>
            <li><strong>2 cloves</strong> garlic</li>
            <li><strong>28 ounce</strong> tomato</li></lie>
            <li><strong>6.5 ounce</strong> canned tomato</li>
            <li><strong>6 ounce</strong> tomato paste</li>
            <li><strong>1/2 cup</strong> of water</li>
            <li><strong>2 tablespoons</strong>white sugar</li>
            <li><strong>1 1/2 teaspoons</strong> dried basil leaves</li>
            <li><strong>1 teaspoon</strong> Italian Seasoning</li>
            <li><strong>12</strong> Lasagna Noodles</li>
            <li><strong>1</strong> egg</li>
            <li><strong>3/4 pound</strong> mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes. Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
